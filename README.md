# ArtCollection
API project

This project was made using a Museum Art Collection API provided by Jeffsteward (https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs). 
The goal of this project was to generate search queries/strings and pull from the API using asynchronous functions, promises and then render the given information on to the page.
